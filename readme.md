# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Gameplay

Players take turns clicking on empty cells on the game board to place their mark (X or O). The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Code

The game logic is implemented in JavaScript using the following features:
- HTML DOM manipulation
- Event listeners
- Arrays and array methods
- Conditional statements
- Loops

The code is well-commented and easy to understand. The game uses a 3x3 grid represented by an array, with each cell's state being either "X", "O", or empty (""). The game state is updated with each move, and the winning conditions are checked after each move to determine if there is a winner or if the game has ended in a draw.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Click on an empty cell to make a move, and the game will automatically switch turns to the other player. If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message will be displayed on the screen. To restart the game, click the "Restart" button.
